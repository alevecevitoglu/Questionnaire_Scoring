Matlab code that scores any questionnaire such as scales used in psychology, sociology, etc.

You need to have:
An excel file (or cvs file) that you seperated each scale in to different sheets.
Naming each sheet as the name of scale is useful.

You need to know:
- If the scale has reverse items 
- min/max of the scale (and sum of it)
- If there are any items that are not scored, you can delete them by hand
(I didn't have this kind of scales much, but a skip/delete step could be add)

The final output excel gives the scored scales in the written order.
(You can also use the reverse coded version if needed)
